#### **About Me**

I am currently a first-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk) at [City University of Hong Kong](http://www.cityu.edu.hk) under the supervision of [Cong Wang](http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~congwang/). I got my B.E. degree of computer science at [Xiamen University](http://www.xmu.edu.cn) at 2018.

#### **Projects**

##### **_A keyword-based auto generating system for Chinese couplets_**

*   Novelly expand the current method for couplets generating based on a given sentence to an approach using given keyword.
*   A phrase-based SMT model is deployed to generate the initial couplet pairs and an approach for optimizing the quality of the couplets based on immune algorithm is proposed.
*   An SVM is trained for the evaluation of the couplets using manually pre-labeled couplets.

##### **_A basketball shooting training and motion tracking system via machine learning (sponsored by [Google University Relations in China](http://www.google.cn/university/collaboration.html), a paper published on FC 2017)_**

*   A neural network embedded on Intel Curie is applied for the evaluation of the shooting performance using features extracted from accelerometer and gyrometer data.
*   Inspired by Robotics, we constrained the possible location of the joints in the arm into certain spaces represented as point-clouds, aiming at simulating the shooting motion.
*   A modified hidden Markov Model is proposed to track the motion of shooting, which its states are defined in the spaces of the point clouds.

##### **_Iteratively collective prediction of disease-gene associations through the incomplete network (a paper published on IEEE BIBM 2017)_**

*   Studied the similarity measure of the nodes in heterogeneous network and came up with “weighted path count with random walk” to fit the complex topological architecture.
*   PU learning is studied and integrated into the classification method in view of negative samples in gene-disease link datasets are extremely scarce.
*   Being different with state-of-the-art singleton approach, an iterative framework for link prediction on heterogeneous network is proposed and deployed on gene-disease link prediction.
